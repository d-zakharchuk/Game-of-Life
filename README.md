# Game of Life
It's Conway's Game of Life simulation program.
Simply set up field size, number of generations, configure start generation.

First generation can be configured using the following methods:
1. Manually in console, "1" - for live cell, "0" - for dead cell
2. Reading the file
3. Randomization.

User also decides whether to print the field to file or console. In case of console variant, there is also an option to enable "Show mode", where new generations are shown step-by-step with user-defined delay between generations.
